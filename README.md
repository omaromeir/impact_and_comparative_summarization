# impact_and_comparative_summarization
This repository contains the code to run impact and comparative summary algorithms

The notebook 'summarization_movies' contains a demo to run an impact summary and comparative summary scenario and look at the rules output.

The \data folder contains the movies, genre, directors data. We provide a clean sample of the movies data as well as the sql scripts to build the database.

\src contains all the summarization algorithms. asp.py is the impact summary algorithm implementation. cps.py is the comparative summary algorithm implementation.

We will continue to update this repository when we have stable version of other pieces of code. This repository already contains both main algorithms to facilitate any future comparisons.
